# P1

Implementation of an LLVM bitcode generator for a simple programming language, P1. The compiler reads and interprets the language specification by first using lexical analysis to scan the source code into meaningful tokens (p1.lex), then by using syntax analysis to parse the generated tokens to produce a parse tree as output (p1.y).
